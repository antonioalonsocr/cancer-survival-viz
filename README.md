# cancer-survival-viz
Data visualization project on data for cancer survival rates. Relationships between races and between genders are explored

## Purpose
The purpose of this exercise was to get more comfortable with data visualization Python libraries, such as matplotlib and plotly. Furthermore, the dataset used for this purpose also serves as a source of information on potential racial disparities in quality of medical accessibility. Naturally, more data and more research is required to find the causation to the differences in survival rates, but let this data demonstrate that these differences exist.

Black people's survival rate seems to be consistently lower than White people's, possibly caused by racial disparity in access to healthcare.

Before visualizing the data, I had the hypothesis that probably differences between races' survival rates would decrease as time went by, in general improving survival rates. While survival rates have improved with the years, it should be eye-opening that racial differences in survival rate have only increased with the years.

White people, when compared to Black people in this data set, never have a lower bottom quartile value, and always have a higher upper quartile and median in survival rates. This should be indication of the issue that still plagues our society in medical accessibility differences between races.

It is a known fact that women have a higher life expectancy than men, so it is not surprising that in most years (except for 2006) women had a higher median than men in their survival rates.

It is surprising to me that females' survival rate, though it has increased over the years, has not done so with the same slope as men's survival rates have.
